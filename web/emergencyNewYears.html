                After talking to Rohan and you about the new years, especially how apparently both of you wrote my notes
                to me first...I felt pretty bad because I didn't even care enough to say anything. I know you probably
                expected more from me, I know I would have in your position. And then after seeing that even Genesis wrote
                you a letter where you aren't even that close to her to write her anything, it's clearly a sign that I
                fucked up!
            </p>
            <p>
                I feel guilty for not being a kinder friend to you than you were to me when you sent me that text...I
                guess it was a combination of misjudgment and disassociation so to make up for that I decided to try
                something and make you an app. Granted I didn't sleep in the transition from 2020-2021, I think (or
                hope) it was worth it, but I guess we'll find out pretty soon!
            </p>
            <p>
                You know, I was thinking about this, and how the New Years is honestly a pretty convenient time to sum up
                the year and all the progress made, but then I also thought that there was really no reason to state all
                the progress we made, merely because it's pretty repetetive but also that there really is no reason we need
                to say anything that we already know. I don't know about you but I'd say we're pretty good friends, we've done
                some stuff (although not as much as we hoped), but we've already talked a lot about it so I don't see how I can
                really say anything new. You're a great friend and I am so lucky to have you (but you already knew that).
            </p>
            <p>
                I already know this is probably the lamest apology you have ever read through, so to make up for that and hopefully
                make amends, I'm caving and getting a snapchat because I know you wanted me to. It's about time, though, because I
                already know a lot of people communicate over snapchat (even though nobody would want to talk with ME). Plus you
                got a Strava and I know how happy that made me so I hope this can make you feel at least part of what I felt, and
                I think it's only fair. Let's just say "new year new me" and get this over with. Now I can show you how Strava works
                and you can show me how Snapchat works!
            </p>
            <p style="margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;">Welp thanks for reading all that, I hope you aren't too butthurt!</p>
